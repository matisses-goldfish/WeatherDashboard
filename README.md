## Description:
---
This application allows travelers to easily access current and forcasted weather for any specified county, state, or city. All data is pulled from the Open Weather API, which provides the weather icon, Temperature, Wind Speed, and UV index. This data is then employed with specific key words and applied to the page. Any location a user enters is then saved to local storage, appended below the search bar, and can be easily clicked to display the given weather. Axios is begin specificly employed to easily access the API with commands, such as axios.get.
